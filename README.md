# EmoTracer

*A renderer that doesn't just simulate light... it simulates feelings.*

EmoTracer is a playful path tracer written in C++17. It's not here to replace your favorite renderer. It's here to stare quietly at the floor and whisper:

> "I rendered something. I hope that's okay."

## âœ¨ Features

- Physically-based shading (Diffuse, Metal, Glass with absorption)
- Directional "emotional" light (blue-ish, of course)
- Cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling for smooth sad bounces
- Sadness accumulation per ray (don't worry, they can handle it)
- Shadow ray blocking, gamma correction, Fresnel-Schlick, and more
- Fully self-contained `.cpp` file (no dependencies except existential doubt)

## ðŸ–¼ Example Output

Two emotionally distant spheres, pretending it's fine:
